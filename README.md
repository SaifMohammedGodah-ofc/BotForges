## üß† Overview  
**BotForges** is a personal project exploring the fusion of **chat-based automation**, **data extraction**, and **intelligent web interaction** ‚Äî all through a single conversational interface.  

Built around the idea of ‚ÄúAutomation/Tools hub,‚Äù BotForges turns everyday tasks into simple chat commands. Whether you want to extract data from a website, recognize text from an image (OCR), or automate a workflow ‚Äî just message your **BotForge Companion** and let it do the rest.  

> ‚ÄúType less, think more ‚Äî let your bot handle the rest.‚Äù
